I started this project because I could not find a simple, free and easy to deploy application that could let me connect to various database systems and query big data files effortlessly. It was intended for personal use only.

But with time I added more features and decided to make it available to others.

This free version of the application is easy to deploy, on a single machine (laptop, server) but wih one application user only. The full version is more suited for enterprise deployment scenarios as it includes the following features:

- multiple users
- SSL configuration
- Ability to connect to a remote cluster Dask cluster (which can also be set up using vQuery docker image) for better scalability (dealing with large sets of data)
- and more
