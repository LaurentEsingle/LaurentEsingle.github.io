veeQuery is a useful tool for Data Engineers, Data Analysts and Data scientists. Its main purpose is to make data discovery and data analysis tasks easier and faster.

Its ability to manage common big data file types, connect to several types of databases and cloud data repositories makes it a powerful tool for those working with big data.

Data analysis can be done using SQL, Pandas and Python.

Just like a Notebook, work in progress - as well as the results - can be saved and retrieved later. This feature is called "pipeline" in the application.

Unlike most notebooks however, most of the work can be done without coding, using the web UI.
