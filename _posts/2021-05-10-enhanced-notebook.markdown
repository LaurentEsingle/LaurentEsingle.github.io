#### Introduction

If you frequently use a notebook for coding activities such as data exploration, data analysis and data visualization, then you will feel at home with veeQuery.

veeQuery can significantly increase your productivity by speeding up most task involved with the above mentioned activities.

Although less flexible and versatile than a traditional notebook, it allows you to perform those activities within a frame that will suit most needs.

Now let's look in details how veeQuery might help you.

#### Extracting data from databases

**With a traditional notebook**

- You need to make sure the target database driver is installed in your system
- Then define the database connection, issue your query and display the results

The code might look like this:

<p></p>
<div align="left"><img src="/images/enhanced_notebook_1.png" width="85%" height="85%" /></div>
<p></p>

**With veequery**

Once you have registered your connection, it is easy to:

- connect to the database
- browse tables content
- issue queries
- get the result nicely displayed in a grid

<p></p>
<div align="left"><img src="/images/enhanced_notebook_2.png" width="85%" height="85%" /></div>
<p></p>

The next step is to save database results into a file that can then be use later for data analysis and data visualization:

<p></p>
<div align="left"><img src="/images/enhanced_notebook_3.png" width="85%" height="85%" /></div>
<p></p>
